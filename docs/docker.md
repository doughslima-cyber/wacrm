# Running with Docker

The repo ships a multi-stage `Dockerfile` (Next.js standalone output,
runs as a non-root user) and a `docker-compose.yml` with a single
`app` service. The database (Cloud SQL behind PostgREST), Firebase
Auth, Storage and Firestore are external — point the app at them via
env vars (`.env.local.example`); no database container is included.
The production deploy on Google Cloud is described in
`docs/firebase-migration.md` (phase 5).

## Quick start

1. Copy the env template and fill it in:

   ```bash
   cp .env.local.example .env.local
   ```

2. Build and start (the `--env-file` flag is required — Compose only
   reads `.env` by default for `${VAR}` substitution, and this project
   keeps its config in `.env.local`):

   ```bash
   docker compose --env-file .env.local up --build -d
   ```

3. The app is served on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
   (publish it elsewhere with `HOST_PORT=8080` in `.env.local`).

> Use `HOST_PORT`, not `PORT`, to move the published port. `PORT` is
> what the server listens on _inside_ the container, and `env_file`
> would inject it there — leaving the app on a port the mapping and
> the healthcheck don't target. Compose pins it to 3000 for that
> reason.

## Build-time vs runtime variables

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` variables are **inlined into the client bundle at
  build time**. They are passed as Docker build args by
  `docker-compose.yml`. If you change any of them, rebuild:
  `docker compose --env-file .env.local up --build -d`. This includes
  `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_LOCALE` (`en | ko | pt | es`), so the UI language is
  fixed per image.
- Everything else (`POSTGREST_JWT_SECRET`, `ENCRYPTION_KEY`,
  `META_APP_SECRET`, …) is read at **runtime** from `.env.local` via
  `env_file` and is never baked into the image — safe to change with
  just a container restart.

## Plain Docker (no Compose)

```bash
docker build \
  --build-arg NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your-project \
  --build-arg NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your-web-api-key \
  --build-arg NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your-web-app-id \
  --build-arg NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your-project.firebasestorage.app \
  -t wacrm .

docker run -d --env-file .env.local -e PORT=3000 -p 3000:3000 wacrm
```

## Notes

- Database migrations are **not** run by the container — apply them
  with `cd infra && npm run db:migrate` (compat layer, `supabase/
  migrations` and `infra/db/migrations`, in that order).
- Received attachments are copied into the `chat-media/` prefix of the
  Cloud Storage bucket, because Meta deletes media roughly 30 days after it
  arrives and the copy is the only thing that outlives that. It grows
  with inbound volume, so it's worth watching your project's storage
  quota. Turn it off per account under Settings → WhatsApp →
  Attachment Storage; attachments received while it's off become
  unviewable once Meta drops them. Files over 16 MB (the bucket's
  limit) are never copied.
- Nothing inside the container is scheduled. If you use automation
  Wait steps or flows, point an external scheduler at
  `GET /api/automations/cron` and `GET /api/flows/cron` on this
  deployment, sending the shared secret in the `x-cron-secret` header
  (`AUTOMATION_CRON_SECRET`, see `.env.local.example`). Both return
  503 until that variable is set.
